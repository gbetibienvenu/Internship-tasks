# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to facilitate the management of library books. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing books in the library. This project aims to demonstrate the use of Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), and MySQL as the database to create a functional and user-friendly library management application.

| `copiesAvailable` | The number of copies available for borrowing, informing users how many copies they can check out from the library.                             |
| `location`        | The shelf or section where the book is stored in the library, which helps users find the book in the physical library space.                   |

- Change into the directory: `cd my-project`
- Initialize Git: `git init`

### Cloning a Repository
**Command:** `git clone <repository-url>`  
**Description:** Clones a remote repository to your local machine, creating a local copy of the repository.  
**Example:** 
- `git clone https://github.com/gbetibienvenu/repository.git`

### Creating Branches
**Command:** `git branch <branch-name>`  
**Description:** Creates a new branch in your repository to facilitate separate development lines.  
**Example:** 
- `git branch feature-branch`

### Committing Changes
**Commands:**
- `git add <file-name>`
- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`  
**Description:** 
- The `git add` command stages your changes.
- The `git commit` command creates a commit with a message explaining the changes.  
**Example:** 
- `git add README.md`
- `git commit -m "Add README file"`

### Reverting Commits
**Command:** `git revert <commit-hash>`  
**Description:** Reverts a specific commit and creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.  
**Example:** 
- `git revert absd1233`

### Pulling and Pushing Changes
**Commands:**
- `git pull origin <branch-name>`
- `git push origin <branch-name>`  
**Description:** 
- `git pull` fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
- `git push` sends your local changes to the remote repository.  
**Example:** 
- `git pull origin main`
- `git push origin main`

### Fetching Changes
**Command:** `git fetch`  
**Description:** Retrieves changes from the remote repository without merging them into your current branch.  
**Example:** 
- `git fetch origin`

### Merging Branches
**Command:** `git merge <branch-name>`  
**Description:** Merges changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.  
**Example:** 
- `git merge feature-branch`

### Renaming Branches
**Command:** `git branch -m <new-branch-name>`  
**Description:** Renames the current branch to a new name, allowing for better clarity in branch naming.  
**Example:** 
- `git branch -m new-branch-name`

### Creating Pull Requests
**Description:** Pull requests can be created via the GitHub interface. Navigate to your repository, switch to your feature branch, and click on "New Pull Request."

### Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests
**Description:** Once a pull request is made, it can be reviewed and merged using the GitHub web interface. Collaborators can provide feedback or approve the changes.

### Reverting Pull Requests
**Command:** `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>`  
**Description:** Reverts a merged pull request by providing the commit hash of the merged pull request, effectively undoing the changes made by the pull request.  
**Example:** 
- `git revert -m 1 hashnumberhere`

Description: Activates Flyway on application startup.

Command: spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true
Description: Ensures migrations run even if the schema isn't empty.

Command: spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration
Description: Specifies the location of migration scripts.

# üìù Database Migration Scripts
The db/migration folder contains the following SQL migration scripts:

1. v1_create_books_table.sql
Description: Creates the books table to store information about books in the library.

2. v2_add_sample_data.sql
Description: Inserts initial sample data into the books table for testing and demonstration.

# üöÄ How to Run the Application
Follow these steps to run the Library Management System:

1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>  
cd <your-project-directory>  
2. Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
Java 17  or higher
Maven
3. Configure the Database:
Update the application.properties file with your database connection settings, if necessary.
4. Run the Application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run  
5. Flyway Migration:
Command: Flyway
Description: Flyway will automatically apply all migration scripts from the db/migration folder during startup.

# ‚ú® Features
