# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to facilitate the management of library books. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing books in the library. This project aims to demonstrate the use of Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), and MySQL as the database to create a functional and user-friendly library management application.

## Entity Fields

### Book Entity
The `Book` entity represents a book in the library system. Below are the fields included in the entity, along with their descriptions:

| Field Name        | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`           | The title of the book. It represents the main name under which the book is published.                                                         |
| `author`          | The author of the book. This field captures the person or entity who wrote the book.                                                          |
| `isbn`            | A unique identifier for books, known as the International Standard Book Number. This ensures that each book can be distinctly recognized.     |
| `publisher`       | The company or entity that published the book, providing information about where the book was produced.                                        |

| `category`        | The genre or category of the book, such as fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, etc. This helps in organizing and searching for books by genre.     |
| `pages`           | The number of pages in the book. This field provides users with an idea of the length of the book.                                            |
| `language`        | The language in which the book is written, indicating the language for reading the book.                                                      |
| `copiesAvailable` | The number of copies available for borrowing, informing users how many copies they can check out from the library.                             |
| `location`        | The shelf or section where the book is stored in the library, which helps users find the book in the physical library space.                   |

# Introduction


BookController Integration Tests: Tests the BookController endpoints using mock services, ensuring correct API responses.
BookService Unit Tests: Tests the logic of BookService, ensuring correct behavior with a mocked repository.
The goal is to ensure all parts of the book management functionality work as expected, including listing, retrieving, adding, and deleting books.

Testing Structure
The test files are organized as follows:



src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ java
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ com
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LibrarySystem
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller
                    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BookControllerTest.java
                    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service
                    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BookServiceTest.java

# 1. BookControllerTest (Integration Test)
The BookControllerTest class, located in controller/BookControllerTest.java, tests the controller layer. Using MockMvc and MockBean, this test suite ensures the BookController methods correctly handle HTTP requests.

# 2. BookServiceTest (Unit Test)
The BookServiceTest class, located in service/BookServiceTest.java, tests the business logic in BookService. It mocks the BookRepository to isolate and validate the service‚Äôs behavior independently of the data access layer.

# Dependencies
You can run these tests, include the following dependencies in your pom.xml:


<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter Test -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Mockito Core -->

        <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>

</dependencies>

# https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core

Annotations and Setup
Each test class uses specific annotations to configure the test environment:

@WebMvcTest: It used in BookControllerTest to set up a Spring MVC context, isolating controller behavior.
@MockBean: It creates a mock instance of BookService in the BookControllerTest, replacing the actual service implementation.
@Mock and @InjectMocks: Used in BookServiceTest to inject mock dependencies into the BookService.
@BeforeEach: Sets up mock data before each test to ensure consistent test conditions.
Test Overview
BookControllerTest (Integration Tests)
The BookControllerTest class tests the API endpoints in BookController using MockMvc for HTTP request simulation:

getAllBooks: Tests the GET /api/books endpoint, checking that it returns the correct JSON response for a list of books.
getBookById: Tests retrieving a book by ID using GET /api/books/{id}, ensuring the correct book data is returned.
addBook: Verifies that POST /api/books correctly adds a new book and returns the expected data in the response.
deleteBook: Confirms that DELETE /api/books/{id} works as expected and returns the appropriate status code.
BookServiceTest (Unit Tests)
The BookServiceTest class tests the business logic in BookService:

getAllBooks: Ensures that the findAll method of the BookRepository is called and returns a list of books.
getBookById: Tests fetching a book by ID, verifying correct book data is returned and handling the case where the book is not found.
addBook: Verifies that a new book can be saved to the repository successfully.
deleteBook: Confirms deletion of an existing book and verifies the correct behavior when attempting to delete a non-existing book.
Running the Tests
To execute the tests, you can use the following commands:

# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test classes
mvn -Dtest=BookControllerTest test
mvn -Dtest=BookServiceTest test

# üìñ Conclusion
This Library Management System offers a reliable starting point for managing book records. With Flyway seamlessly handling schema changes, developers can focus on extending the system‚Äôs features without worrying about database inconsistencies.
